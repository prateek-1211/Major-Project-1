Developed a system to provide real-time flight status updates
and notifications to passengers as a major project in the 7th
semester.

Features include displaying flight statuses (delays,
cancellations, gate changes), sending notifications via SMS,
pulling data from airport databases, and visualizing the flight
route between departure and destination locations with a blue
line representing the distance, implemented using OOP
concepts in React.js.
